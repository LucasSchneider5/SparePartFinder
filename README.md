# SparePartFinder

**Search for a specific spare part by entering the part number**

**Note: This project is not ready jet! I have to add some things and fix bugs :)**

**How to:**
* Enter your spare part catalogue (It is marked, where to put the URL)
* Put your Database in the project-tree
* There is the possibility that you have to rework a function, in order to read the Database-file properly
